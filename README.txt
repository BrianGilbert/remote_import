Remote import - Provision
=========================

This Drush extension allows you to fetch remote sites from remote Aegir servers.

Installation
------------

You need to place this extension within the provision directory so that the
'remote_import' directory is on the same level as the 'provision.service.inc'.
On the server that you want to import into, you do not need to install anything
on the server that sites will be copied from.

You probably want to install the Remote import - Hostmaster project into your
Aegir frontend.
